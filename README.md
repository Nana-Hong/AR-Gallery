## Description
This project explores art forms from impressionism, cubism, and abstraction through the lens of computational thinking. We have selected paintings by representatives of each period to recreate, including Monet's Water Lilies, Picasso's Apples, and Kandinsky's Composition No. 8, which are processed and analyzed by touch designer to convert the images into digital art. Jackson Pollock, Number 23, uses gesture recognition and allows the viewer to simulate the form of the original work and try to create it themselves. The interactive AR and physicality approach provides a deeper understanding and a new artistic experience.

## Inspiration
After visiting many museums, we found that many places will provide their own guide equipment, and that equipment can scan the works in the exhibition, and then display the introduction through AR. So we want to make an AR art exhibition. Not only to appreciate the paintings in reality, but also to enjoy the digital paintings in the virtual world.

## Idea developments

We decided the size of our space at first, which can let us quickly know how big project we would make. And then the exhibition organization team can give us the suitable space as quick as possible.

In the beginning, I cut out the characters from the art painting. I was going to turn a 2D flat character into 3D.
I imagined static flat art paintings coming to life, allowing them to travel through a 3D world. Through some 2D to 3D plug-in systems, add depth to the picture, so that the 2D picture becomes a 3D model. However, the reality was very difficult. Because of the recognition system, when the object was converted into 3D, the model would be inaccurate. So I gave up this attempt and planned to model it myself.

After that, I tested the objects in the AR mode in Unity. In this idea, the experiment was very successful. So we mainly plan to use Unity to implement our AR Gallery.

## Final Design
<img width="923" alt="截屏2023-06-26 18 11 11" src="https://git.arts.ac.uk/storage/user/588/files/abbcc4ae-bdcb-4200-ab15-b0457d4dc5ce">

After our careful selection, we chose these 4 paintings. They represent different thoughts in different periods. In order to ensure the quality after printing, we searched for these paintings on the Tate website. After that, we will use modern art tools to create on the basis of these four paintings, so as to show the artistic expression of different tools in different periods.

## Technology & Software
I am good at modeling, so I mainly use Rhino and Unity. I also mainly researched the AR effect of Vuforia in Unity, and turned the paintings we created into AR effects. And Chen Qi is good at TouchDesigner, so she is responsible for converting art paintings into digital effects in the form of digital codes.

I made my first painting Water Lilies with Qi. She made the lotus lake with TouchDesigner, and I made the lotus with Rhino and Unity. The lotus models were built in Rhino, then I imported them into Unity and added animations. These lotus flowers will sway with the swaying water in the pool, and the light circle around them is made by particle effects.

After that I made the second painting APPLE. As before, I finished modeling in Rhino and imported it into Unity. Edit script Visual Studio to make the object rotate, and, use particle effects to make floating clouds.

Later Composition 8 was produced by Qi Chen through TouchDesigner. Number 23 is also made by DouchDesigner. Among them, the brush has the function of disappearing, and finally forms the effect of splashing.

![Aspose Words 12d599f1-681a-44a6-9af5-650a1e4c4b9e 020](https://git.arts.ac.uk/storage/user/588/files/0adf1610-ee94-4efc-9241-ce21518e9e71)

Number 23 is the last painting, we intend to let the audience participate in the completion. Leap motion is a suitable device. Just by moving on the device, players can splash out their paintings like a painter.

Here are the results of our final three paintings.

## Test
![Aspose Words 12d599f1-681a-44a6-9af5-650a1e4c4b9e 025](https://git.arts.ac.uk/storage/user/588/files/f066623f-fa9c-4114-954b-56e9e2a05872)
![Aspose Words 12d599f1-681a-44a6-9af5-650a1e4c4b9e 026](https://git.arts.ac.uk/storage/user/588/files/998e8684-7d04-4f4f-b065-3aa379f9083e)

After that, we experimented and tested our AR project and Leap motion project through mobile phones and other devices. What is different from what we expected is that when Unity's AR project is exported, it must be associated with a fixed device. That is to say, if you want to experience the export effect of AR, then every time the viewer has to bind with the ID in Unity, then you can watch the effect. Or use our own mobile phones to visit the audience. However, these effects will be greatly reduced.

The ideal result is to turn the effect into a QR code, and then the audience can see the result by scanning the code. So we therefore use the third-party platform 8th Wall. Here we only need to upload our scanned object, and upload the corresponding model or animation. Originally we made a 3D animation model, but because the model format and platform files did not match many times, we had to convert the model into an animation and upload it.

Finally, our QR code has been completed and is in effect. So we can use any mobile phone to scan this QR code, and then use the lens in this platform to scan the picture to get AR animation.

![Aspose Words 12d599f1-681a-44a6-9af5-650a1e4c4b9e 028](https://git.arts.ac.uk/storage/user/588/files/aaf5edf0-29ac-4456-8e92-554df995b8ec)
![Aspose Words 12d599f1-681a-44a6-9af5-650a1e4c4b9e 029](https://git.arts.ac.uk/storage/user/588/files/c1e8fb7d-4c77-47c7-bb96-728b24be2a8f)

At the same time, I tried to scan after printing 4 paintings, and the effect was very smooth. The interactive dynamics of Leap motion were also very successful.

## Final Exhibition
![Aspose Words 12d599f1-681a-44a6-9af5-650a1e4c4b9e 030](https://git.arts.ac.uk/storage/user/588/files/4fd657e9-a0bf-49a9-b051-1bf44b2f5398)
![Aspose Words 12d599f1-681a-44a6-9af5-650a1e4c4b9e 031](https://git.arts.ac.uk/storage/user/588/files/10085af5-7025-4f2f-aad5-62a759e6cfba)

Due to the large number of works on display, we were assigned a very small location, which was not as expected. But luckily we are using AR technology, so the viewer doesn't need a big space. We just need to make room for the manual interaction of Leap motion.

![Aspose Words 12d599f1-681a-44a6-9af5-650a1e4c4b9e 032](https://git.arts.ac.uk/storage/user/588/files/3e4c1442-ec38-41c9-862e-253677943d6c)
![Aspose Words 12d599f1-681a-44a6-9af5-650a1e4c4b9e 033](https://git.arts.ac.uk/storage/user/588/files/b8023c53-5e2a-4b20-87bb-be6c104eb8c7)

In the CCI exhibition, our works were surprisingly well received. Because the interaction mode is simple, all passers-by viewers will stop to watch our AR Gallery. The interactive mode of Leap motion is the finishing touch. Everyone loves to create paintings with their own hands on this interactive device.
